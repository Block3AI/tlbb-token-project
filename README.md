The TLBB Token Project is a decentralized, charity-driven token initiative built on the Solana blockchain. This project leverages Rust for secure, high-performance smart contract development. Our aim is to create a transparent and impactful ecosystem supporting charitable causes.

Features

	•	Decentralized Token (TLBB): Built on Solana using Rust.
	•	Smart Contracts: Secure and optimized for token transactions and governance.
	•	Charity Integration: A portion of each transaction contributes to pre-defined charitable initiatives.
	•	Scalable Framework: Designed to support future expansions into Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains.
